If no rule was found, the position updates anyway after the end of this loop so the difference is only the break command which happens only if the rule is found. This defenitely takes more processing power and considers overlapping rules but this is the way to go to consider all the possible cases. Also, note that this raises the issue of exponential slow-down when the number of rules in a table increase. Therefore, I assume we need some sort of bloat removal when the speed of the tool has decreased drastically.
